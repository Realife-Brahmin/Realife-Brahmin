### Hi there!!! :bowtie:  

I am Aryan Ritwajeet Jha. Realife_Brahmin is my most common username on most sites, including Github (slight variations may be necessary to fit the site's username needs).
- Strengths: A Friendly Friend. NOT afraid of getting out of my technical comfort zone.
- Weaknesses: Having to do manual labour when there is clearly a scope for automation. Global Variables. Undocumented Code. Code with no version control. ðŸ˜”
- Opportunities: Going on a few trips this summer would be nice.
- Threats: Bland food. ðŸ˜£
